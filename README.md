# Hi, I'm Ignacio 👋

I'm a software developer from Chile who enjoys building useful, real-world solutions.  
I got into tech driven by curiosity about how things work, and I stayed because I love turning complexity into real, working software.

Right now I'm focused on backend development, system architecture and AI engineering. I care about impact, developer experience, and writing software that solves actual problems.
